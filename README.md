My intro into the embedded world with [Atmel's XMega Xplained evaluation board.](http://www.atmel.com/tools/XMEGA-A1XPLAINED.aspx?tab=overview)

The goals of this project are three-fold. 

1. Learn some C. 
2. Get down to the metal and learn about embedded programming. 
3. Discover what kind of future projects are possible.
